GPI Data Pipeline  Documentation
======================================================


.. _intro:

The Gemini Planet Imager Data Pipeline allows transformation of raw data from
GPI into calibrated spectral and polarimetric data cubes. It also provides some
basic capabilities for PSF suppression through differential imaging, and for
astrometry and spectrophotometry of detected sources.


**Software and documentation by:** Marshall Perrin (STScI), Jérôme Maire
(University of Toronto), Patrick Ingraham
(Stanford), Dmitry Savransky (Cornell), JB Ruffio (SETI, ISAE), Max Millar-Blanchaer (Toronto), Schuyler Wolff (JHU), 
Naru Sadakuni (UCSC and Gemini), Christian Marois (NRC) and
other members of the GPI Data Analysis Team.  Please see the
:ref:`development credits <sw-credits>` for a complete list of contributors, and the :ref:`release notes <release-notes>` for further details.

**Acknowledging the GPI Pipeline in Publications:** Users of the GPI data pipeline should cite one of the following:

 * `Maire et al. 'Data Reduction Pipeline for the Gemini Planet Imager', 2010, Proc. SPIE vol. 7735 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010SPIE.7735E.102M>`_
 * Perrin et al. 'Gemini Planet Imager Observational Calibrations I: Overview of the GPI data analysis pipeline', 2014 (in preparation, for SPIE meeting)

**Getting Help**: The main channel for support of this software is the `Gemini Data Reduction Forum <http://drforum.gemini.edu>`_. Please post questions there
and mark them with the tag `gpi`. Members of the GPI data analysis team monitor that forum to help support the Gemini community in using GPI.
